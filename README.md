# Customer-Segmentation-RFA-Analysis-and-Kmeans-Clustering-
Customer segmentation involves grouping customers according to how and why they buy.
This allows organizations to develop more targeted sales, retention  and marketing strategies for different customer segments. 
It's basically the process of dividing your users or customers into segments using similar characteristics like purchase frequency,amount spent, demographics, behavioral patterns and so much more.

This analysis focuses on segmenting our customers using the behavioral patterns seen in their purchase history. We analyzed the trends seen in each demographic to help understand the market performance of each product in the operating countries but I decided to do a behavioral segmentation because understanding your customers or users makes it easier to create a better personalized experience for each segment.
We will create a Recency frequency monetary pie chart and cluster pie chart(using k means clustering) for this project.
For this study, we took the data from UCI Machine Learning called Online Retail dataset.
The dataset  is a transactional data that contains transactions from December 1st 2010 until December 9th 2011 for a UK-based online retail.
